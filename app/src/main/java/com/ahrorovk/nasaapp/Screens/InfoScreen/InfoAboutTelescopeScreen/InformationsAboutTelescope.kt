The lifetime of the telescope is mainly limited by the amount of fuel for maneuvering around the point L 2 . The initial calculation was 5-10 years . However, during launch, it was possible to make an extremely successful maneuver and the current fuel supply is limited to 20 years, but not all devices can work for that long."

In total, 286 out of more than one thousand applications were selected in seven main areas of astronomy, which in total will take about six thousand hours of observational time of the telescope, which is about two-thirds of the total time allocated in the first observation cycle.

This process is repeated until the shape of the mirror segment is close to ideal. Next, the segment is cooled to a temperature of −240 °C , and the dimensions of the segment are measured using a laser interferometer .
